Go to this airflow link and press the 'trigger dag' button. After 10-15 minutes it should say success and if you go into the run all tasks should run.


Because lab 8 hasn't been graded yet and I had to do HW4 by then, I had to change my airflow environment (bc of a limit to the number of active environments at a single time) and due to that the results/work from lab 8 were not saved from that. I did take a screenshot of the successful run when I did run it though and I've included it in the repo.
